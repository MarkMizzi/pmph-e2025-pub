# Programming Massively Parallel Hardware (PMPH), Block 1, 2025

### We are grateful to Nvidia for awarding us a teaching grant (for the PMPH and DPP courses) that consists of two A100 GPUs. These are now accessible on the Hendrix GPU cluster.

## Course Structure

PMPH is structured to have four hours of (physical) lectures
and four hours of (physical) labs per week; potentially we
will have no lectures in the last few weeks of the course, so you
can concentrate on project work (to be announced).

[Course Catalog Web Page](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak14008u/2025-2026)

### Lectures:

* Monday    13:00 - 15:00 (aud - AUD 01 AKB, Universitetsparken 13)
* Wednesday 10:00 - 12:00 (aud - Aud 01 HCØ, i.e., Universitetsparken 5, HCØ)

### Labs:

* Monday    15:00 - 17:00 (aud - AUD 01 AKB, Universitetsparken 13)
* Wednesday 13:00 - 15:00 (aud - Aud 03, Universitetsparken 5, HCØ)

### Flexible Schedule on Wednesday

For *Wednesdays*, we have also reserved room (aud - Aud 03, Universitetsparken 5, HCØ)
in continuation, from 15:00 -- 17:00, so that we can stay over if necessary.


### Physical Attendence to Lectures and Labs

The current plan is that everybody will have a physical place
at the lectures and labs. Unless we are forced to move to virtual
teaching (very unlikely), the lectures and labs will not be recorded,
so please plan to attend. If there is a strong request, we may stream
the lectures, but without providing any guarantees as to the quality
of streaming.

### Evaluation

Throughout the course, you will hand in six assignments, which will sum
up to 100 points. Final grades are computed according to the following scheme:
* $\geq$ 90 translates to grade 12
* $\geq$ 80 translates to grade 10
* $\geq$ 66 translates to grade  7
* $\geq$ 56 translates to grade  4
* $\geq$ 50 translates to grade  2
* $<$ 50 means fails, i.e., grade 0

All assignments are individual in the sense that each student has to fully 
understand all aspects of the solution (which includes the submitted code)
and the report should include personal reflections on the handed-in solution.
However, some assignments can be solved by a group of students, as detailed
in the itemized list below, and the report should document the name of the
student who wrote a specific section/part of the report. Of course, all
group members should have roughly equal contributions to the solution and
report writing.
If there is disagreement within a group, you may duplicate disputed sections
to have different content, while documenting the name of the authors.

* Assignment 1: 10 points, fully individual solutions and report.

* Assignment 2: 15 points, fully individual solutions and report.

* Assignment 3 (10 points) and 4 (15 points) are to be solved in groups of two.
  Both have the same hand-in and hand-out date, as detailed later, since they
  have a common theme: optimizing locality of reference.

* Assignment 5 (25 points) and 6 (25 points) are to be solved in groups of 3 or 4,
    roughly during the last month of the course.
    They essentially consists of a larger project, in which Assignment 5 refers to
    submitting the code solution, and Assignment 6 refers to submitting the report.
    This intends to stress that the quality of the report will be reflected in
    the final grade. Meaning: if the report is poor, you will loose points.
    It also stands to reason that the quality of the report is also tightly
    related to the quality of the solution (implementation), i.e., if the solution
    is not up to the standards, the report is bound to suffer as well.

* There will be no oral presentation of the "group" project (i.e., Assignment 5 & 6),
    because the course have grown and there are too many students enrolled in PMPH.

Assignments 1-4 can be resubmitted *once*, within one week since the time that
you received feedback for each of them. If you did not got the maximal number
points you are allowed to resubmit, only if you wish (not mandatory).

For Assignments 5 and 6, no resubmission is possible, as the deadlines are
just before exam week (Assignment 5) and within the exam week (Assignment 6).

For more information on weekly assignments and (re-)submission, please see [this
section](#weekly-assignments).

**The submission of all Assignments is on Absalon. Please do NOT submit solutions on this Github Repo.**
